## c/cpp implementation on Grokking Algorithm

It's a simple but funny book. [https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)

Thank [Yuci](https://github.com/yucicheung) for the book, and an english PDF file can be found on website.

=====================================================

Since its simpleness and briefness, the implementation code here is not strictly correct.

Also I did not see any of the official source code. So, this is not a c/cpp implementation of the official python source code. Anyway, coding for fun is the theme.

=====================================================

Note:
- Code are implemented with Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 10, and possible mistakes can be occur with GCC complier on Linux. Just modified by yourself.
