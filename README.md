## c/cpp implementation on Grokking Algorithm

It's a simple but funny book. [https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms)

Thank [Yuci](https://github.com/yucicheung) for the book, and an english PDF file can be found on website.

=====================================================

Since its simpleness and briefness, the implementation code here is not strictly correct.

Also I did not see any of the official source code. So, this is not a c/cpp implementation of the official python source code. Anyway, coding for fun is the theme.

=====================================================

Note:
- Code are implemented with Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 10, and possible mistakes can be occur with GCC complier on Linux. Just modified by yourself.

## Content

### Ch-1, Introduction to Algorithms

- Binary Search for sorted sequence

### Ch-2, Selection Sort

- Select the maximum/minimum each time ($\mathcal{O}(n^2)$)

### Ch-3, Recursion

- Recursive implementation of Fibonacci numbers

### Ch-4, Quick Sort

- An introduction to `Divide & Conquer (D&C)`, and many instances (Max Square, Sum, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort) are implemented

### Ch-5, Hash Tables

- An introduction to Hash tables, for quick search

### Ch-6, Breadth-First Search

- Apply BFS to find the shortest route (without weight side, like personal relation network) with 'queue'

### Ch-7, Dijkstra's Algorithm

- An algorithm to find the shortest route, suit to weighted directed acyclic graph with non-negative side

### Ch-8, Greedy Algorithms

- Find a local optimal solution, approximating global solution, for NP problem. Select the local optimal solution at each step.

### Ch-9, Dynamic Programming

- Through some instances for better understanding of DP, such as Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Substring, and Longest Common Subsequence. Learn to solve a hard problem by breaking it up into subproblems and solving those subproblems first (how to define and construct a suitable table for problems). 

### Ch-10, K-nearest Neighbors
